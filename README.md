# Simple Precision 100 Shell Client
A simple single file shell interface to the Precision100 framework

## Quick Usage
```
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:ennovatenow/scheduler-precision-native.git
cd scheduler-precision-native
./precision-shell-wrapper-sample.sh
```

This will create the `$HOME/precision100` folder and execute the `simple-demo` project.

> The `--recurse-submodules` parameter is required while cloning because we have a dependency with Precision100 framework.

### A longer example
To-do

## Operating System Requirements
The simple client has the same requirements as the Precision 100 Framework, it uses the `bash` shell for most of its work, more specifically it uses bash 4.2 features like associative arrays. Although all development and tests of the framework is done on `linux`, the framwork should run on any operating system supporting the `bash` shell.
Make sure you check your `bash` version.

```
$ bash --version
